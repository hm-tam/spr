      <h3>Select Imaging Procedures</h3><hr><p><strong>Brain MRI <strong>Without & With</strong> Contrast</strong>
      </p><p>MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the brain. The images acquired are used to diagnose and detect normal, diseased, or injured brain and assist in determining how the brain is functioning, as well as for assessing the potential risks of surgery or other invasive treatments of the brain. This MRI examination will require the patient to receive an injection of contrast into the bloodstream. The contrast material used for an MRI exam, called gadolinium, does not contain iodine and is less likely to cause side effects or an allergic reaction.
      </p><hr><p><strong>MRI Lumbar Spine Without Contrast</strong>
      </p><p>This exam shows the anatomy of the vertebrae that make up the spine, as well as the disks, spinal cord and the spaces between the vertebrae through which nerves pass. In this procedure, only the lumbar (lower) portion of the spine will be imaged.
      </p><hr><p><strong>MRI of Joint Lower Extremity</strong>
      </p><p>This exam produce detailed pictures of the body's major joints to diagnose or evaluate degenerative joint disorders such as arthritis and meniscus tears (knee), joint abnormalities due to trauma, tumors involving joints, and pain, swelling or bleeding in the tissues in and around the joints.
      </p><hr><p><strong>MRI Cervical Spine Without Contrast</strong>
      </p><p>MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures that show the anatomy of the vertebrae that make up the spine, as well as the disks, spinal cord and the spaces between the vertebrae through which nerves pass. In this procedure, only the cervical (neck) portion of the spine will be imaged.
      </p><hr><p><strong>Brain MRI Without Contrast</strong>
      </p><p>This exam produces detailed pictures of the brain. The images acquired are used to diagnose and detect normal, diseased, or injured brain and assist in determining how the brain is functioning, as well as for assessing the potential risks of surgery or other invasive treatments of the brain. This MRI examination does not require the patient to swallow contrast material or receive an injection of contrast into the bloodstream. The contrast material used for an MRI exam, called gadolinium, does not contain iodine and is less likely to cause side effects or an allergic reaction.</p><hr><p><strong>MRI Angiography <strong>Without & With</strong> Contrast</strong>
      </p><p>In magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer produce detailed images and is used to examine blood vessels in the brain to identify the effects of a stroke, other disease and/or aneurysms. The brain MRA is also used for surgical planning and treatment.
      </p><hr><p><strong>MRI Joint Upper Extremity Without Contrast</strong>
      </p><p>MRI imaging uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the body's major joints to diagnose or evaluate degenerative joint disorders such as arthritis, joint abnormalities due to trauma, tumors involving joints, and pain, swelling or bleeding in the tissues in and around the joints.<br>

      </p><p style="line-height: 22.4px;">Answer: Your physician has ordered a diagnostic procedure known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI. MRI uses a magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to create extremely detailed images of the human body. Before your exam begins, an MRI technologist will ask you some medical questions, explain your procedure and assist you into the MRI room. You will be asked to lie on a padded table, which will move into the magnet opening, and your exam will begin.
      </p><hr style="line-height: 22.4px;"><p style="line-height: 22.4px;"><strong><i>Question: What information will I need to provide prior to my MRI examination? </i></strong>
      </p><p style="line-height: 22.4px;">Answer: You will be asked to complete a medical questionnaire that will assist the technologist in assuring that the highest quality exam is performed. <br>
      </p><p style="line-height: 22.4px;"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please make sure your physician and the technologist performing your exam know if you have a pacemaker, prosthesis, aneurysm clips, metal implants or other metal objects in your body.

      </p><p style="line-height: 22.4px;">Answer: Your physician has ordered a diagnostic procedure known as Magnetic Resonance Elastography of the Liver or MRE. MRE uses a magnetic field, radio waves and acoustic driver to create shear waves in a liver, which is harmless, similar to liver palpation by a physician. Before your procedure begins MRI technologist will explain the imaging procedure and will ask you to sign a consent form, because the MRE is a procedure developed at Mayo Clinic ─ Rochester by Dr. Ehman and his group. During MRE mechanical waves are generated in tissue and a remarkably sensitive phase-contrast MRI technique, using synchronous motion-sensitizing gradients, is used to directly image the pattern of wave propagation. Specially developed mathematical algorithms are used to analyze the wave images and to generate quantitative images depicting the stiffness and other mechanical properties of tissue. The MRE technology high sensitivity for liver disease has allowed physicians to spare many patients from having a painful, unnecessary ─ and more expensive ─ liver biopsy.</p><hr style="line-height: 22.4px;"><p style="line-height: 22.4px;"><strong><i>Question: Is there any preparation on my part prior to MRE? </i></strong>
      </p><p style="line-height: 22.4px;">Answer: Most MRE examinations require no preparation. However, for exams that do require preparation, information will be provided to you by your physician’s office.
