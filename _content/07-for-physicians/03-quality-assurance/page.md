<hr><h3>Peer Review</h3><p>At St. Paul Radiology, we use <a href="http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/practice-management/future-radiology-peer-review" target="_blank">RADPEER</a>, a peer review software to assist with quality control and to further our commitment to excellence and enhancing patient health.
</p><p>RADPEER is a product developed by the American College of Radiologists, that serves as a simple, effective method to track the accuracy of radiology interpretations. With RADPEER, randomly selected studies are reviewed, and feedback is provided on image quality and interpretation.
</p><h3>Collaboration</h3><p>Physicians make a difference by working together. St. Paul Radiology participates in clinical conferences at the hospitals we partner with. This is a vital link to our clinical colleagues, and provides us with valuable insight into care and diagnosis. Within our group of over 70 radiologists, subspecialty expertise and second opinion are immediately available.<br>
