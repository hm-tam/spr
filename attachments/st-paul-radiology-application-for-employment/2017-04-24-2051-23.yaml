21_experience_A_exit_reason: "I love it here and still plan on working there very part time. However, my current employer Dr. Kary does not offer health insurance, or any other benefits beside free chiropractic care and discounts on nutrition and other products.  He also does not offer paid vacations. I love to learn and grow personally and professionally, I have worked for this company as a whole since 2007 and I feel like now that I'm older and my parents are entering retirement age I need a job that offers a better benefits package that I can grow and mature with for the long term."
