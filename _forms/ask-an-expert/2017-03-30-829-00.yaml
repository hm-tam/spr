message: 'I was investigated for malaise and some non specific symptoms in Mar 2016. A CT scan was conducted and was negative. I have been speaking to a new doctor and he wants to explore something called paraneoplastic syndrome. As I am an ex-smoker he explained that the negative CT was a great result but we could go down the route of a PET/CT to exclude this paraneoplastic syndrome, I think he said it had a relationship with lung malignancy and would be good to rule out this paraneoplastic condition. Is this something that is offered at St Paul Radiology and would this scan rule out the paraneoplastic syndrome by excluding malignancy. I will be funding this myself so insurance is not an issue. I want to make sure I am getting the right advice.  Thanks You.'
