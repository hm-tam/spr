  Hello - My mother had a brain aneurysm rupture on Jan 18th, 2017.  She was taken to Regions Hospital and Dr. Goddard performed a life saving IR coil procedure.  Her name is Julie Conner.  Her recovery has been long and hard, but she is doing amazing and we couldn't be more thankful.
  Dr. Goddard (along with almost every other doctor that saw my mom at Region's) suggested that I (her son) get an MRA brain scan as aneurysms can be genetic.  I have started looking into this.  Unfortunately my insurance will not cover any of the MRA, so I am trying to get this done as efficiently as possible.   Regions hospital quoted me about $750 to get the brain scan done and read, but I would need an order from a doctor before scheduling.  Would your facility require a doctors order as well?  Is there any way to avoid paying for yet another doctor appointment just to get scheduled for a procedure I know that I need.  Could you give me a quote for receiving an MRA at your facility instead of Regions? Any help/advice would be much appreciated!  Again, we couldn't have been more pleased with the procedures, services and communications we received from Dr. Goddard and SPR staff.
