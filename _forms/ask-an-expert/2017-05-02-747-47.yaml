  I have paid for a Come Play Pass and want to book a tee time for one of my pass rounds (no more than one day in advance. Had a layover in Orlando on my way to a wedding, so instead of working on my laptop (Saturday after all!) or indulging in a mimosa and bfast when I wasn t really hungry, I used my time wisely and popped in for a pedicure and an eyebrow wax. There were plenty of staff working around 8:30am on a Saturday, so even though most of the chairs were occupied (massages), they were able to squeeze me in without issue. The eyebrow wax was painless and relatively quick and the pedicure was basic (which is what I paid for) and pleasant. No extras, as the idea was to get in and out and that is just what I did. I felt much more wedding ready after that. Willing to work weekends/extended hours.

  Years ago in 1986, a car stops outside the Grey residence in a quiet neighborhood. Out of the car step two men: Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. Erik turns to his friend and says he still doesn't know why he's there - couldn't Charles just make them say yes. As they start walking towards the house, Xavier answers that he could, but it's not his way, and he would expect Erik of all people would understand his feelings about misuse of power. Erik asks when Charles will stop lecturing him, and Xavier answers he'll stop when Erik starts listening, and states that Erik is there because he needs him. Frustrated a bit, Erik asks if they'll have to meet each and every one of them in person, and Charles says no вЂ“ but this one in special. Please send cover letter, resume, and 3 references to.
