  Hello, greetings, I just see that people have alive discussion at this place. 
  I am looking for someone with an experience of running an AFFILIATE WEBSITES? I made some cash with GOOGLE ADSENSE before but not much. My friend has suggested to get a WEBSITE at flipper.top (here is URL if you are lazy to type it, <a href=http://flipper.top/>direct link - "WEBSITE BROKER")</a> - I hope it can work! It looks like they are making good MONEY MAKING SITES. please share your opinion and experience? I was not able to find a good looking 
  FREE AFFILIATE WEBSITE and flipper.top sounds affordable. Thank you so much!
