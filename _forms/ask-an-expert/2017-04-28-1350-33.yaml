message: 'An incidental finding in my recent dural AVM procedure showed a small aneurysm behind my left eye that will eventually need to be taken care of.  How long is the recovery from that procedure, and will I have any difficulty reading and studying after it is done?  I am trying to figure out the timing of this, as I withdrew from my last semester of school because of the procedure I already had done and am scheduled to start again in August.  Related: Iâ€™m due for a follow-up cerebral angiogram in late July/early August; is this something that can be done in conjunction with the surgery to take care of the aneurysm?  Trying to figure out if I should get this scheduled sooner rather than later.'
