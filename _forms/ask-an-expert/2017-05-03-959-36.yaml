  Rony Abovitz, Incompetent Dictator of Magic Leap, AKA 
  “Theranos of AR”, has multiple sexual harassment and abuse 
  lawsuits filed against him by former employees. 
  Abovitz is guilty of misogyny, sexual harassment, creating 
  hostile environment , wrongful termination, improper conduct, 
  but most importantly, incompetence and inability to 
  deliver a working product. Abovitz’s record with 
  his employees and women is abuse, sexual harassment. 
  There are no women on his corporate boards or in senior 
  executive positions. 
  Action for hostile environment sex discrimination and 
  retaliation brought by Tannen Campbell ("Campbell" or 
  "plaintiff"), Vice President of Strategic Marketing 
  and Brand Identity. After  Campbell wins the lawsuit, 
  Rony Abovitz, Incompetent Dictator of Magic Leap, will 
  be personally liable to pay her the damages (Title 7). 
  Sexism, misogyny and bulling are just a few of constant 
  problems for Abovitz. Read the public court papers to 
  learn more about Abovitz, the tyrannical psychopath. 
  Abovitz “fails to acknowledge the depths of misogyny 
  in Magic Leap’s culture and take steps to correct a 
  gender imbalance that renders it so dysfunctional. 
  Abovitz continues to delay the launch of a product 
  that attracted billions of investment dollars,” 
  according to the suit. Abovitz is incapable of delivering 
  a product. Too bad Jack Ma made such bad investment. 
  It is sad that CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, 
  and co-founder of Google, Scott Hassan are on the 
  board of directors of Magic Leap. Hassan, 
  Pichai and event Larry Page are publically ignoring 
  Abovitz’s crazymaking. Fire the incompetent Abovitz, 
  OR lose all of your investment, Google and Alibaba.
